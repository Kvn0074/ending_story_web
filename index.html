        <p>You’ll take my life But I’ll take yours too, You’ll fire your musket But I’ll run you through,
           So when you’re waiting For the next attack,You’d better stand There’s no turning back !
           The bugle sounds and the charge begins, But on this battlefield no one wins, The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
           As I plunge on into certain death<br>
           Ooooooooh! Ooooooooh!  <br>
           The horse he sweats with fear we break to run, The mighty roar of the Russian guns
           And as we race toward the human wall, The screams of pain as my comrades fall.
           We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground, And the Russians fire another round,
           We get so near yet so far away. We won’t live to fight another day !! <br>
           Ooooooooh! Ooooooooh!.</p>
